</p>

A self-contained Discord music bot built with Python and `discord.py`. It's designed for easy setup and robust performance, running as a background service using `screen`. The included `launch.sh` script handles the complete setup, including dependency installation, environment configuration, and automatic generation of necessary files like `__init__.py`.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Self-Contained Installation**: The `launch.sh` script automatically sets up a virtual environment and installs all dependencies.
- ‚úÖ **Background Operation**: Runs in a `screen` session, ensuring the bot stays online.
- ‚úÖ **YouTube Integration**: Play audio from YouTube URLs, playlists, and search queries.
- ‚úÖ **Full Playback Control**: `play`, `pause`, `resume`, `skip`, `stop`.
- ‚úÖ **Queue Management**: `add`, `remove`, `clear`, `shuffle`, and `view queue`.
- ‚úÖ **Audio Controls**: Adjust `volume` and playback `speed`.
- ‚úÖ **Looping**: Toggle looping for the currently playing song.
- ‚úÖ **Admin Commands**: `shutdown` and `restart` the bot remotely.

## üéØ Target Environment

This bot is primarily developed and tested on **Debian 12 (Bookworm)**. The `launch.sh` script includes commands to install dependencies like `ffmpeg` using `apt-get`, which is specific to Debian-based distributions.

It is suitable for deployment in various environments:
-   **Bare Metal**: A dedicated physical machine running Debian 12.
-   **Type 1 Hypervisor**:
    -   **Proxmox VE**: Can be run inside a Virtual Machine (VM) or a Linux Container (LXC).
-   **Type 2 Hypervisor**:
    -   **VirtualBox**, **VMware Workstation/Fusion**: Can be run inside a Debian 12 guest VM.

While it may work on other Linux distributions, you might need to manually install the required system dependencies (`ffmpeg`, `libopus-dev`) using your distribution's package manager.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `git`
- `ffmpeg` and `libopus-dev` (The setup script will attempt to install these on Debian-based systems).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Make the Launch Script Executable**
    You may need to grant execute permissions to the launch script.
    ```bash
    chmod +x launch.sh
    ```

3.  **Configure the Bot**
    You can configure the bot in one of two ways:

    **Method 1: Using a `.env` file (Recommended)**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file with your credentials using a text editor like `nano`:
    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```
    See the **Configuration Details** section below for more information on what to put in this file.

    **Method 2: Hardcoding in `config.py`**
    If you prefer, you can hardcode your credentials directly into the `config.py` file.
    ```bash
    nano config.py
    ```
    **Note:** This is not recommended, especially if your code is in a public repository.

4.  **Run the Setup Script**
    This command prepares the environment, installs all Python packages, and makes the other scripts executable.
    ```bash
    ./launch.sh setup
    ```

## ü§ñ Usage

The `launch.sh` script is your control center for the bot.

## üîß Configuration Details

-   **`DISCORD_TOKEN`**: Your Discord bot's authentication token. You can get this from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) by creating an application and adding a bot.
-   **`YOUTUBE_API_KEY`**: Your YouTube Data API v3 key. This is required for the `?search` command. You can obtain one from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com).
-   **`BOT_OWNER_ID`**: Your personal Discord User ID. This is used for owner-only commands. To get your ID, enable Developer Mode in Discord's settings, then right-click your username and select "Copy User ID".
-   **`LOG_CHANNEL_ID`**: The ID of the Discord channel where the bot will send logs. Get this by enabling Developer Mode, right-clicking the channel, and selecting "Copy Channel ID".
    -   **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** The bot can be very verbose with its logging. It is highly recommended to create a separate, dedicated channel for logs to avoid spamming a general chat channel.
    -   **üí° Tip:** To avoid potential Discord API rate-limiting from excessive logging, you can use the `?leave` command to make the bot leave the voice channel, which can help reduce log output.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Troubleshooting

-   **Bot is offline or not responding:**
    -   Ensure the bot is running with `./launch.sh attach`. If the session is not active, start it with `./launch.sh start`.
    -   Check the `bot.log` file for any errors.
    -   Verify that your `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correct.

-   **No audio is playing:**
    -   Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed correctly. The setup script attempts to install it, but it might fail.
    -   Check the bot's logs for any `ffmpeg` or `opus` related errors.

-   **`?search` command is not working:**
    -   Ensure your `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` is correct and that the YouTube Data API v3 is enabled in your Google Cloud project.
