A self-contained Discord music bot built with Python and `discord.py`. It's designed for easy setup and robust performance, running as a background service using `screen`. The included `launch.sh` script handles the complete setup, including dependency installation, environment configuration, and automatic generation of necessary files like `__init__.py`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `git`
- `ffmpeg` and `libopus-dev` (The setup script will attempt to install these on Debian-based systems).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Configure the Bot**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the example file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file with your credentials. See the **Configuration Details** section below for more information.

3.  **Run the Setup Script**
    This command prepares the environment, installs all Python packages, and makes the scripts executable.
    ```bash
    ./launch.sh setup
    ```

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Troubleshooting

-   **Bot is offline or not responding:**
    -   Ensure the bot is running with `./launch.sh attach`. If the session is not active, start it with `./launch.sh start`.
    -   Check the `bot.log` file for any errors.
    -   Verify that your `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correct.

-   **No audio is playing:**
    -   Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed correctly. The setup script attempts to install it, but it might fail.
    -   Check the bot's logs for any `ffmpeg` or `opus` related errors.

-   **`?search` command is not working:**
    -   Ensure your `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` is correct and that the YouTube Data API v3 is enabled in your Google Cloud project.
