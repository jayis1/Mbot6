## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `git`
- `ffmpeg` and `libopus-dev` (The setup script will attempt to install these on Debian-based systems).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

The bot is designed for a quick and easy setup.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Configure the Bot**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can use the example file as a template.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file with your credentials:
    ```dotenv
    DISCORD_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token"
    YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your_youtube_api_key"
    BOT_OWNER_ID="your_discord_user_id"
    LOG_CHANNEL_ID="your_discord_log_channel_id"
    ```

3.  **Run the Setup Script**
    This command prepares the environment, installs all Python packages, and makes the scripts executable.
    ```bash
    ./launch.sh setup
    ```
